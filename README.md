README: Predictive Model for Chemical Data

##Introduction
This repository contains a predictive model designed to analyze chemical data and make accurate predictions. This model can be particularly useful for professionals in fields such as chemistry, pharmacology, and materials science, where understanding and predicting chemical properties and behaviors are crucial.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw chemical data for optimal model performance.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict chemical properties and behaviors.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing chemical data and prediction results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting data and obtaining predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chemical-data-prediction.git
   cd chemical-data-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your chemical data is in a CSV format with appropriate columns.
2. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input your_data.csv
   ```
   Replace `your_data.csv` with the path to your chemical data file.

3. **Visualize results**: The model will output prediction results and generate visualizations that can be accessed in the `output` directory.

## Model Training
To train the model with your own dataset, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data your_training_data.csv
```
Replace `your_training_data.csv` with the path to your training dataset.
